Run by calling "launchall.sh dataset_textfile.txt" from VHbbAnalysis/Heppy/test/crab[_data] directory
- Tried to comment out old lines w/ "#A" at beginning of line. Not always the case, but shows most of the changes I made.

crab/launchall.sh: 
- For each line in the dataset_textfile.txt, launchall.sh sets environmental variable DATASET to the line, then calls:
     crab submit -c heppy_crab_config_env.py

crab/heppy_crab_config_env.py:
- loads "heppy_crab_config.py" as a source.
- sets up the input and output dataset tags using env DATASET variable.

crab/heppy_crab_config.py:
- Sets up crab request
	**CHANGE NAME OF REQUEST, line 5
- Sets up a project area
	**CHANGE NAME OF PROJECT AREA, line 6
- uncommented outputfiles (line 37)
- Changed unitsPerJob to 5 (cut down on EOS accesses).
   **CHANGE config.Data.*. See below.
	config.Data.outLFNDirBase = '/store/user/leptonjets/noreplica/godshalk/2016-10_ZJNtuples2015_/crab_output'
	config.Data.publication = False      <-- changed from true.
	config.Data.outputDatasetTag = 'ZPJ_2015'   <-- Changed  to personal dataset tag.
- Sources heppy_crab_fake_pset.py as a fake pset, but really runs heppy_crab_script.sh instead.

crab/heppy_crab_script.sh - sets up environment and calls heppy_crab_script.py

crab/heppy_crab_script.py - sets up environment, output, sources heppy_config.py
 - crab/heppy_config.py is a hard link to vhbb_combined.py
 - vhbb_combined_data.py sourced in crab_data folder.

vhbb_combined.py
 - does extra configuration
 - sources vhbb.py
 - Nothing changed.
vhbb_combined_data.py -> changed source file for testing purposes
 - May need to change again

vhbb.py
- Sets up VHbb Analysis stuffs, including VHbbAnalyzer.py, vhbbobj.py from python folder.
- Sets up objects to be recorded.
- Sets up object analyzer variables (lepton pt, jet info, etc.)
- changed sample file to work on lpc xrootd dy file.
- changed passall to false (otherwise passes every event despite selection = HUGE FILES)
- changed leading zLepton selection to 15 instead of 20 (to match sub-leading lepton)

vhbbobj.py
- Sets up objects used in anlysis, output in Heppy
- changed to include Jet_vtxMassCorr and Jet_vtxPx/y/z

VHbbAnalyzer.py
 Around line 490-500, changed selection criteria to include either
 - a selected Z(Vtype = 0 or 1)
 - an event with at least 1 selected lepton but not selected as W (Vtype = 5) - good for zeu analysis
	 - Could also include VType = 2,3 for W selection

VType classified in VHbbAnalyzer.py: classify[MC]Event()
 -1 = no selection
 VtypeSim: zuu = 0, zee = 1, wuv = 2, wev = 3, zvv = 4, ztt = 5
 VType: zuu = 0, zee = 1, wuv = 2, wev = 3, no leptons AT ALL = 4, at least one good z-lepton = 5
